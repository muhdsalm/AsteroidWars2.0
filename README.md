# Note: This project is no longer maintained. It was a fun learning project, and maybe if I feel nostalgic I'll come back to this one day. It's a nice cute project, but nothing amazing.


# AsteroidWars2.0
The new and updated version of Asteroid Wars! This version is a complete rewrite of the program, with tons of new features!
The old one was written in Java, this version is in Godot. https://godotengine.org/
## What is it?
Asteroid Wars is a game based off the Asteroid shooting game. This game, however takes it to the next level.
The idea is simple: You control a spaceship, and you have to destroy the Asteroids.
However, Asteroid Wars add tons of new features, such as:
- Bosses
- Multiple rockets
- Powerups
- And much, much more.
## Can I play?
As of yet, the game is in active development, so we are not providing builds of the game.
However, feel free to download the game and build it yourself. Instructions are provided here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html. 
One of the advantages of using a game engine is how easy it is to build the project.
## How can I contribute?
The project isn't well structured (we'll work on that) right now, so there are no clear-cut ways to know what to do. If you've played the game and encountered a bug, please leave an issue. 
Also, if you have any suggestions, feel free to create an issue on that too. If you want to work on the project, then you can try to fix some issues? I'm sorry if it sounds rude, 
it's just that there's pretty much no way to know what to do. Again, will work on that soon.
